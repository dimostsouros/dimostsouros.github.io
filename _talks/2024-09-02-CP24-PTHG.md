Our workshop paper on "Generalizing Constraint models in Constraint Acquisition" was presented in the Progress Towards the Holy Grail workshop at the CP Conference. 

Abstract: Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to widen the use of constraint programming by helping users in the
modeling process. However, most CA methods learn one ground CSP: a set of individual constraints for
a specific problem instance. We focus on generalizing ground CSPs, by learning parameterized constraint
models that can model multiple instances of the same problem.

We propose a constraint-level classifier-based
approach, where a machine learning classifier is trained to predict for any possible constraint and any possible
parameterization of the problem whether the constraint belongs to the problem. A key aspect is an appropriate
parameterized feature representation that allows classifiers to learn (implicit) patterns in the ground CSP. The
results of our evaluation show that our approach has high accuracy in learning generalized models, and is robust
to the presence of noise in the ground CSP.
